# AGraph

This is a simple swift app, developed for the course "Sviluppo applicazioni per dispositivi mobili".

This app allows to place and render agumented 3d graphs (from csv tables on a dropbox directory)
through an iphone camera.

# Usage

run 'pod install' from the project directory, to add all the missing dependecies.

At the end of the process, open 'ProjectMobidev.xcworkspace' from XCode and run the project.
